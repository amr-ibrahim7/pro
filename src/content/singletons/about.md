  I'm Amr, a web developer with a passion for turning complex problems into elegant, user-friendly digital experiences. My journey into tech began after exploring the business world, where I discovered that my true calling was in building and creating. This led me to dive head-first into the world of code.

  Over the past couple of years, I've dedicated myself to mastering the MERN stack and modern web technologies. I thrive in environments that value clean code, thoughtful design, and continuous learning. I believe that the best products are built at the intersection of powerful engineering and intuitive design.

  When I'm not coding, I enjoy exploring new creative tools, contributing to open-source projects, and staying up-to-date with the ever-evolving landscape of web development. I'm always excited about new challenges and opportunities to collaborate on impactful projects.
