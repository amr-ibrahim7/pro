projectPurposeAndGoal: |
  The primary goal of "Thoughts" was to design and build a full-stack, feature-rich blogging application from the ground up. I wanted to create a platform that was not only functional and secure but also offered a clean, modern, and intuitive user experience. The project served as a comprehensive exercise in architecting a RESTful API, managing databases, handling user authentication, and building a responsive frontend with modern tools.

webStackAndExplanation:
  - stackName: 'Node.js & Express'
    explanation: 'The backend is powered by a robust Node.js server using the Express framework to create a scalable and efficient RESTful API for handling all data operations.'

  - stackName: 'MongoDB & Mongoose'
    explanation: 'MongoDB was chosen as the database for its flexibility with unstructured data. Mongoose was used as an ODM to model application data, manage relationships between users and posts, and simplify data validation.'
    icon: '/images/logos/mongodb-icon.svg'
  - stackName: 'React & Vite'
    explanation: 'The frontend was built as a Single Page Application (SPA) using React and Vite for a lightning-fast development experience and optimized builds. The component-based architecture ensures the UI is modular and easy to maintain.'
    icon: '/images/logos/react-icon.svg'
  - stackName: 'JWT Authentication'
    explanation: 'User authentication and authorization are handled using JSON Web Tokens (JWT). This stateless approach ensures that the API remains secure and scalable, protecting user data and private routes.'

problemAndThoughts: |
  One of the main challenges was designing a secure and seamless authentication flow. I implemented a secure system using JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) stored in `localStorage`. On the backend, custom middleware intercepts requests to protected routes, verifying the token's validity before granting access. Another challenge was managing state across the application. I used React's Context API to create separate contexts for authentication, posts, and user data. This approach kept the state management logic organized and prevented prop-drilling, making components cleaner. For file uploads, I used `multer` to handle `multipart/form-data`, converting images to Base64 strings to be stored directly in MongoDB, which simplified deployment and data retrieval.

lessonsLearned: |
  This project was a fantastic learning experience that solidified my understanding of full-stack development. I learned how to structure a scalable backend API, implement secure authentication, and manage complex application state on the frontend. Building a custom UI library from scratch using Tailwind CSS and utility components (like shadcn/ui) highlighted the importance of creating a consistent and reusable design system. Most importantly, I learned how to connect all the pieces of a modern web application, from the database to the user's screen, creating a cohesive and functional product.

### The Story Behind "Thoughts"

The idea for "Thoughts" was born from a simple desire: to create a clean, minimalist, and performant space for sharing ideas, free from the clutter of modern social media. My goal was to build a full-stack application entirely from scratch to deeply understand the entire lifecycle of a web productâ€”from designing a database schema in MongoDB to creating a fluid, interactive user experience with React.

My focus was on the core experience of writing and reading. This meant prioritizing a fast, responsive UI built with **Vite** and **Tailwind CSS**, and ensuring that core features like user authentication and real-time comments felt seamless and secure. One of the technical decisions I'm proud of is the file handling strategy. Instead of relying on a third-party storage service, I used **Multer's** `memoryStorage` to process uploaded images, convert them to Base64 strings, and store them directly within MongoDB. This approach made the entire application self-contained and significantly simplified the deployment process on platforms like Vercel.

This project wasn't just about building another blog; it was about architecting a complete digital product and mastering the MERN stack in a practical, hands-on way that balanced powerful engineering with intuitive design.
