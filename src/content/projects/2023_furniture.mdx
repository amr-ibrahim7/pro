projectPurposeAndGoal: |
  The goal of "ImagineYourHome" was to build a complete, visually appealing landing page from scratch using only fundamental web technologies. As one of my early personal projects, it was a crucial step in mastering core HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The primary focus was on translating a design into a pixel-perfect, responsive layout and implementing all interactive elements with vanilla JavaScript to gain a deep understanding of the DOM.

webStackAndExplanation:
  - stackName: 'HTML5 & CSS3'
    explanation: 'The entire site was built with semantic HTML5 and vanilla CSS, featuring a responsive layout created from scratch using custom media queries and Flexbox. This ensured a faithful translation of the design to the browser.'

  - stackName: 'Vanilla JavaScript (ES6)'
    explanation: 'All interactive features—such as the mobile navigation, video player, and scroll-to-top functionality—were implemented with plain JavaScript to practice direct DOM manipulation and event handling.'
    icon: '/images/logos/javascript-icon.svg'
  - stackName: 'Bootstrap & jQuery'
    explanation: 'Bootstrap was utilized for its robust grid system to practice structuring layouts, while jQuery was used to explore simplified DOM interactions, a common approach in traditional web development.'

problemAndThoughts: |
  The main challenge in this project was managing the UI state (e.g., the open/closed status of the mobile menu, the video player state) without a framework. I handled this directly through JavaScript by toggling CSS classes and manipulating element properties. This hands-on experience with the DOM was invaluable, as it gave me a deep appreciation for the declarative approach of libraries like React, which I adopted in later projects to manage state more efficiently. Implementing responsive navigation and interactive sliders from the ground up, and ensuring they worked flawlessly across all devices, was another significant learning point.

lessonsLearned: |
  This project was a fantastic learning experience that solidified my understanding of foundational frontend development. I learned the importance of writing clean, maintainable vanilla CSS and JavaScript, how to structure a project for responsive design, and the discipline of building a polished product from scratch. It provided the essential understanding of the DOM that made my transition to modern frameworks like React much more intuitive and effective.

### The Story Behind "ImagineYourHome"

"ImagineYourHome" represents a significant milestone in my journey as a developer. As one of my first major personal projects, I challenged myself to build a complete marketing landing page using only the core technologies of the web: HTML, CSS, and plain JavaScript.

Working without a modern framework like React, I built every feature from the ground up. This meant writing all the responsive logic with custom CSS media queries and handling every user interaction—like the mobile menu and the Swiper.js carousel—through direct JavaScript DOM manipulation. This project forced me to understand how the web works at a fundamental level. While I've since adopted more advanced tools like Next.js and state management libraries, "ImagineYourHome" stands as a testament to my solid foundation and my passion for building things, marking a key step in my path to becoming a professional developer.
